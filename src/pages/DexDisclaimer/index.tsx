      <p>
        Decryption Exchange is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that people
        can use to create liquidity and trade TL20 tokens. The Decryption
        Exchange protocol is made up of free, public, open-source or
        source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are
        deployed on the TLChain Network. Your use of the Decryption Exchange
        protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses
        while digital assets are being supplied to the Decryption Exchange
        protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a
        trading pair or liquidity pool. Before using the Decryption Exchange
        protocol, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you
        understand how the Decryption Exchange protocol works.

        Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as SMTP
        through multiple email clients, you can access the Decryption Exchange
        protocol through dozens of web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible
        for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees
        and risks they present.

        <br />
        AS DESCRIBED IN THE DECRYPTION EXCHANGE PROTOCOL LICENSES, THE
        DECRYPTION EXCHANGE PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. Although TLChain Network ( "TLChain" )
        developed much of the initial code for the Decryption Exchange protocol,
        it does not provide, own, or control the Decryption Exchange protocol,
        which is run by smart contracts deployed on the TLChain Network. No
        developer or entity involved in creating the Decryption Exchange
        protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated
        with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users
        of, the Decryption Exchange protocol, including any direct, indirect,
        incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, or
        loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.
