      <br />
      <p>Last updated: February 22, 2022</p>
      <br />
      Warm welcome and thank you for your interest in Decryption Exchange and
      our website to https://Decryption.exchange, a website-hosted user
      interface (the "Platform") provided by TLChain Network S.R.L. ("TLChain
      Network", "we", "our", or "us"). The Platform provides access to a
      decentralized protocol on the TLChain blockchain that allows users to
      trade certain digital assets. The Platform is one, but not the exclusive,
      means of accessing Decryption Exchange.
      <br />
      This Terms of Use Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding
      agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Platform. This
      Agreement explains the terms and conditions by which you may access and
      use the Platform. You must read this Agreement carefully. By accessing or
      using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and
      agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree,
      you are not authorized to access, and you don’t have our permission to use
      the Platform.
      <br />
      (!)IMPORTANT: Please read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use
      of the Platform. This Agreement contains important information. The
      Platform is only available to you — and you should only access the
      Platform — if you agree completely with these terms.
      <br /> <br />
      ELIGIBILITY <br />
      To access or use the Platform, you must be able to form a legally binding
      contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age
      of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., eighteen years old) and have the
      full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms
      and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and/or of any legal
      entity, organization, or company for which you may access or use the
      Platform and that you have the authority enter in this Agreement. You
      further represent and warrant to us that your use of the Platform is in
      compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations and that you
      will not access or use the Platform to conduct, promote, or otherwise
      facilitate any illegal activity.
      <br /> <br />
      AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT
      <br /> We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to periodically
      modify this Agreement. If we make any amendments, we will notify you by
      updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining a current
      version of the Agreement at https://Decryption.com /terms. All
      modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your continued
      accessing or use of the Platform will serve as confirmation of your
      acceptance of those modifications. It is your responsibility to review the
      most recent version of this Agreement and remain informed of any changes.
      If you do not agree with any amendments to this Agreement, you must
      immediately stop accessing and using the Platform.

      Agreement, we are granting you a limited, revocable license to access and
      use the Platform solely for non-commercial purposes to learn more about
      Decryption Exchange and its services.
      <br /> <br />
      PRIVACY
      <br /> When you use the Platform, the only information we collect from you
      is your blockchain wallet address, completed transaction hashes, and the
      token names, symbols, or other blockchain identifiers of the tokens that
      you swap. We do not collect any personal information from you (e.g., your
      name or other identifiers that can be linked to you). We do, however, use
      third-party service providers, like Cloudflare, and Google Analytics,
      which may receive or independently obtain your personal information from
      publicly available sources. We do not control how these third parties
      handle your data and you should review their privacy policies to
      understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information. We
      use the information we collect to detect, prevent, and mitigate financial
      crime and other illicit or harmful activities on the Platform. For these
      purposes, we may share the information we collect with blockchain
      analytics providers. We share information with these service providers
      only so that they can help us promote the safety, security, and integrity
      of the Platform. We do not retain the information we collect any longer
      than necessary for these purposes. Please note that when you use the
      Platform, you are interacting with the TLChain blockchain, which provides
      transparency into your transactions. TLChain Network does not control and
      is not responsible for any information you make public on the TLChain
      blockchain by taking actions through the Platform.
      <br />

      You agree not to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the following
      categories of forbidden activity in relation to your access and use of the
      Platform: Intellectual Property Infringement. Activity that infringes on
      or violates any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, right of
      publicity, right of privacy, or other proprietary or intellectual property
      rights under the law. Cyberattack. Activity that seeks to interfere with
      or compromise the integrity, security, or proper functioning of any

      viruses and denial of service attacks. Fraud and Misrepresentation.

      <br />
      <br /> NO INVESTMENT OR FINANCIAL ADVICE <br />
      You agree and understand that all trades you submit through the Platform
      are considered unsolicited, which means that you have not received any
      investment advice from us in connection with any trades, and that we do
      not conduct a suitability review of any trades you submit. All information
      provided by the Platform is for informational purposes only and should not
      be construed as investment advice. You should not take, or refrain from
      taking, any action based on any information contained in the Platform. We
      do not make any investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits
      of any investment transaction or opportunity. You alone are responsible
      for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related
      transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment
      objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.
      <br /> <br />
      NO WARRANTIES
      <br /> The Platform is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To
      the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim any representations and
      warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including
      (but not limited to) the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
      particular purpose. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the
      Platform is at your own risk. We do not represent or warrant that access
      to the Platform will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure; that
      the information contained in the Platform will be accurate, reliable,
      complete, or current; or that the Platform will be free from errors,
      defects, viruses, or other harmful elements. No advice, information, or
      statement that we make should be treated as creating any warranty
      concerning the Platform. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume
      responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third
      parties concerning the Platform.
      <br /> <br />
      NON-CUSTODIAL AND NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES
      <br /> The Platform is a purely non-custodial application, meaning you are
      solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to
      the digital asset wallets you hold. This Agreement is not intended to, and
      does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest
      extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no
      fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the
      extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those
      duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and
      eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we
      owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.
      <br /> <br />
      COMPLIANCE <br />
      OBLIGATIONS The Platform is operated from facilities within Romania. The
      Platform may not be available or appropriate for use in other
      jurisdictions. By accessing or using the Platform, you agree that you are
      solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and
      regulations that may apply to you.
      <br /> <br />
      ASSUMPTIONS OF RISKS
      <br /> By accessing and using the Platform, you represent that you are
      financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
      inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based
      systems and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies
      of digital assets such as TLCHAIN (TLC), LSO, The Luxury (TLX), and other
      digital tokens such as those following the Tlchain Digital Token (TL20).
      In particular, you understand that blockchain-based transactions are
      irreversible. You further understand that the markets for these digital
      assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to)
      adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You
      acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with
      cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as TLChain are variable
      and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and
      accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their
      value while they are supplied to Decryption Exchange, you may suffer loss
      due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity
      pool, and experience significant price slippage and cost. You understand
      that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens
      and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and
      accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You
      further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables
      or risks, do not own or control the Platform, and cannot be held liable
      for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the
      Platform. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full
      responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Platform.
      <br /> <br />
      THIRD PARTIES RESOURCES AND PROMOTIONS
      <br /> The Platform may contain references or links to third-party
      resources, including (but not limited to) information, materials,
      products, or services, that we do not own or control. In addition, third
      parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of the
      Platform. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such
      resources or promotions. If you access any such resources or participate
      in any such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand
      that this Agreement does not apply to your dealings or relationships with
      any third parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability
      arising from your use of any such resources or participation in any such
      promotions.
      <br /> <br />
      RELEASE OF CLAIMS
      <br /> You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with
      your access and use of the Platform and your interaction with the TLChain
      blockchain. You further expressly waive and release us from any and all
      liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way
      relating to your use of the Platform and your interaction with the TLChain
      blockchain.
      <br /> <br />
      INDEMNITY
      <br />
      You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our
      officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and
      subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
      liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access and use of
      the Platform; (b) your violation of any term or condition of this
      Agreement, the right of any third party, or any other applicable law,
      rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party's access and use of the
      Platform with your assistance or using any device or account that you own
      or control.
      <br /> <br />
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
      <br /> Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors,
      employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to
      you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or
      exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of
      profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of
      or relating to any access or use of the Platform, nor will we be
      responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking,
      tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Interface or the
      information contained within it. We assume no liability or responsibility
      for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal
      injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from any
      access or use of the Interface; (c) unauthorized access or use of any
      secure server or database in our control, or the use of any information or
      data stored therein; (d) interruption or cessation of function related to
      the Interface; (e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be
      transmitted to or through the Platform; (f) errors or omissions in, or
      loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of, any content made
      available through the Platform; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or
      illegal conduct of any third party. Under no circumstances shall we or any
      of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or
      subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities,
      obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount
      you paid to us in exchange for access to and use of the Platform, or
      USD$100.00, whichever is greater. This limitation of liability applies
      regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort,
      negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been
      advised of the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not
      allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion
      of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers
      and limitations set forth in this Agreement may not apply to you. This
      limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by
      law.
      <br /> <br />
      DISPUTE RESOLUTION
      <br />
      We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through
      informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must
      contact us by sending an email to legal@TLChain.network so that we can
      attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution.
      <br /> <br />
      GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION
      <br />
      Regardless of your place of residence or where you access or use the
      Platform from, this Agreement and your use of the Platform will be
      governed by and construed solely in accordance with the laws of Romania.
      The competent courts in Romania will have exclusive and sole jurisdiction
      over any dispute, claim or controversy relating to the Platform or with
      respect to any matter relating to this Agreement. You hereby expressly
      consent to personal jurisdiction in Romania and expressly waive any right
      to object to such personal jurisdiction or the non-convenience of such
      forum. You further agree that the Platform shall be deemed to be based
      solely in Romania, and that although the Platform may be available in
      other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or
      specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside Romania.
      <br /> <br />
      ENTIRE AGREEMENT
      <br /> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us
      concerning the subject matter herein and supersede all prior and
      contemporaneous negotiations and oral representations, agreements, and
      statements.
